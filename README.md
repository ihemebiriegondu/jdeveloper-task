    A logistic company wants to develop a transportation Queue. On the left is a table with the list of delivery for customers, showing customer ID, Customer Name, Pick Up location, Drop off Location, on the right is a planner, showing Date, Slot 1 , Slot 2, Slot 3, Slot 4, the planner should show 7 days after the current date.


So the logistic company wants to be able to drag customers from the Logistic Queue to the planner for each slot so this needs to be saved to the database, which is in MySQL.
